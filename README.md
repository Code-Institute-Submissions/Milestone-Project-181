# Milestone-Project-1
1st Project for Code Institute. 
A personal portfolio site to display my education, skills and experience.
It will be used as a basis to show to future recruiters that would have need of my skills and experience.
It will have 3 pages, a homepage with my basic information, another page showcasing skills and experience and another for projects.

UX:
This website is focused on employers and recruiters who are looking for potential candidates based on their skills and experience. 
It makes it easier for recruiters to find potential candidates instead of having to look through multiple cvs.
This project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
Wireframes were created showcasing the three pages of the website.
One wireframe showcases the pages viewed on a web browser, another on a smartphone and another on a tablet.
Wireframes are in pdf format and are in the wireframes directory.
