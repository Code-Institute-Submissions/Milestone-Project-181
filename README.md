## UX:

## User Stories:

![Projects](https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-1/blob/298bbd75a7025796b8167ab1fa4e658282b695b1/assets/images/user_stories_projects.png)

## Strategy:

I wanted to create a user friendly website to show the necessary information for recruiters and employers.

## Scope:

I wanted to provide users a preview of projects i have created and the skills i have.

## Structure:

I wanted to provide my basic information to users, then point them towards the projects i have created,with links to each live project included.

I also provided my profile links to GitHub and LinkedIn, as well as creating a form for users to contact me. 

I also gave users the option to download my CV for easy access.

## Surface:

I chose the blue background with the text color of white for my name and job title so that it would stand out.

The brown background was chosen along with the black text color so that again it would stand out and not be too distracting.

The orange background footer was chosen to compliment the white text colour.

## Icons:

I used Font Awesome for the social media icons of GitHub and LinkedIn.

## Wireframes:

I have included wireframes for each page on this website, click on the below page names to see these wireframes:

[Download CV](https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-1/blob/main/assets/wireframes/Milestone%20Project%201%20CV.pdf)

## Features:

<p align="center"><strong>Existing Features:</strong>

<strong>Feature 1:</strong>

The navigation bar on the top will stay to the screen when the user scrolls down the page when viewing on a tablet or phone for easy navigation to the other pages,

<strong>Feature 2:</strong>

The download CV page allows Employers and Recruiters to download to a copy of my CV in pdf form.

<strong>Feature 3:</strong>

Each link that brings users to my projects will have a background image of the index of each projects pages as a preview.

## Features Left to Implement:

For the contact form i would like to be able to have any input entered in the fields to be sent to my personal email address, this will require some kind of security to prevent spam emails being sent to my mailbox.

## Technologies Used:

[HTML](https://html.com/)
Used to create the structure of the web site.

[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
Used to style the website

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Used to design the site for mobile users and for other features.

## Libraries:

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
Used frequently for icons used throughout the website

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn-_lgbiJ7QIVn4BQBh1X3Av6EAAYASAAEgL1XfD_BwE)
used for the creation of wireframes

## Version Control:

[Github](https://github.com/) - Used to store the code and use of Github Pages to deploy the website. 

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) - Used as the primary version control IDE for development to further push and commit code to Gihub.

## Other:

[Code Institute Course Content](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) - Primary source of learning code.

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - used as a general resource for CSS and coding tips.

[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - used as a general resource for layout tips or questions.

[AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - Used to check how the layout of the website looks across different devices. 

## Testing:

This website was tested through 3 Web Browsers, Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

All three displayed the exact same website layout without any noticeable changes.

The Projects page has hyperlinks to websites i created in the past.

These links are behind the projects icons.

All links on the site when clicked on will open to a new tab.

On the CV page when the user clicks on the CV icon a copy of my CV will be opened in a new tab for users to view and download.

The website was tested on an Android smartphone and a Samsung Tablet.

The website has being designed to accommodate the screen sizes of smartphones and tablets. 

On the Contact form page of the website, the name and email fields are required and must be filled before clicking the submit button. 

At the moment, once a user clicks on the Submit button,nothing happens. 

In the future i plan to build the form so that messages will be sent to my email.

## Validation:

HTML - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) - Markup Validation

## Project Bugs and Solutions:

For the links that are behind the projects icons, i tried to figure out a way of getting an image of each sites homepage to use for background image but was unable to,so icons were used instead.

Fixed the location of the CV pdf file i add linked to in the CV section due to moving the CV to the assets folder,however due to settings i have on Firefox, when i clicked on the CV icon it downloaded straight away to my download folder.

Removed the horizontal scrollbar that was visible on the website, was caused by not having the row div class in the footer being wrapped inside the container fluid div class.

One thing i noticed is when viewed on the tablet and is set to be displayed like on a PC through the Rotate button, some parts of the site were not aligned to the center, particularly the footer section and the About Me section on the homepage.

This issue was resolved as it has turned out that because i was using the Bootstrap Grid System, i had set the col- size to 4, instead of setting it to 12.

After changing this, the site layout on a PC now looked like the layout that was on the smartphone and tablet.

For the blue background image, i added margin to the bottom as the image was too small and would leave whitespace below it.

## Remaining bugs: 

When viewing the the website through [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/),i noticed that on the screens of the PC monitor and tablet, there was whitespace after the footer that does not appear on the mobile and applebook view.

![Bug](https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-1/blob/a4b7eb5c892b7df69376706752b4667303cdccbe/assets/images/whitespace%20footer%20index.png)

This whitespace would only appear on the index,the contact and the download CV pages viewed on a tablet and PC, the other pages did not have this whitespace.

I tried adding 0 margin to the top and padding of 0 to the footer but this had no effect.


## Deployment:

This website is hosted through GitHub Pages and any changes made to the website are shown almost immediately after pushing to GitHub.

For the website to work an index html had to be created before GitHub Pages can display the website.
