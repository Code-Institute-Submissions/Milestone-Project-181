## Features:

<p align="center"><strong>Existing Features:</strong>

<strong>Feature 1:</strong>

The navigation bar on the top will stay to the screen when the user scrolls down the page when viewing on a tablet or phone for easy navigation to the other pages,

<strong>Feature 2:</strong>

The download CV page allows Employers and Recruiters to download to a copy of my CV in pdf form.

<strong>Feature 3:</strong>

Each link that brings users to my projects will have a background image of the index of each projects pages as a preview.

 <p align="center"><strong>Features Left to Implement:</strong>

For the contact form i would like to be able to have any input entered in the fields to be sent to my personal email address, this will require some kind of security to prevent spam emails being sent to my mailbox.

## Technologies Used:

[HTML](https://html.com/)
Used to create the structure of the web site.

[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
Used to style the website

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Used to design the site for mobile users and for other features.

## Testing:

This website was tested through 3 Web Browsers, Microsoft Edge,Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

All three displayed the exact same website layout without any noticeable changes.

The Projects page has hyperlinks to websites i created in the past.

These links are behind the projects icons, i tried to figure out a way of getting an image of each sites homepage to use for background image but was unable to.

All links on the site when clicked on will open to a new tab.

On the CV page when the user clicks on the CV icon a copy of my CV will be opened in a new tab for users to view and download, however due to settings i have on Firefox, when i clicked on the icon it downloaded straight away to my download folder.

The website was tested on an Android smartphone and a Samsung Tablet.

The website has being designed to accommodate the screen sizes of smartphones and tablets, however one thing i noticed is when the tablet is set to be displayed like on a PC, some parts of the site are not aligned to the center, particularly the footer section and the About Me section on the homepage.

This issue was resolved as it has turned out that because i was using the Bootstrap Grid System, i had set the col- size to 4, instead of setting it to 12.

After changing this, the site layout on a PC now looked like the layout that was on the smartphone and tablet.

## Deployment:

This website is hosted through GitHub Pages and any changes made to the website are shown almost immediately after pushing to GitHub.

For the website to work an index html had to be created before GitHub Pages can display the website.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/SeanD17/Milestone-Project-1.git` into your terminal. 

To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
